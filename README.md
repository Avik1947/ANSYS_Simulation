# ⚗️ Ammonia Production Process

## 🎯 Objective  
Design a continuous, scalable process for ammonia (NH₃) synthesis via the Haber-Bosch route—optimizing energy, conversion, and recycle integration within industrial constraints.

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
Ammonia is a cornerstone of global fertilizer and chemical industries, yet its production is energy-intensive and non-trivial. The goal:  
- Engineer a complete process flow  
- Specify key equipment  
- Analyze stream conditions  
- Optimize recycle and purge strategy for sustainability

## 🛠️ Process Overview  
- **Feedstock**: Syn-gas (H₂, N₂, CH₄, CO, Ar)  
- **Main Reaction**:  
  \[ N₂ + 3H₂ → 2NH₃ \]  
- **Auxiliary Reactions**: Steam methane reforming and partial oxidation for syn-gas generation

## 🧪 Block Components  
- **Compressors** (x2): 75% adiabatic efficiency  
- **Heater**: Brings feed to 500°C  
- **Reactor**: 40% single-pass conversion based on N₂  
- **Cooler & Separator**: NH₃ extracted at 10°C, 174.9 bar  
- **Purge & Recycle Streams**: Purge rate = 1% of S-8, recycling unreacted gases

---

## 📊 Key Design Specs  
- **Operating Pressure**: up to 275 bar  
- **Mass Flow**: 61,300 kg/hr feed  
- **NH₃ Output**: 59,540 kg/hr bottom product  
- **Recycle Flow**: 42,214 kg/hr N₂ + H₂
